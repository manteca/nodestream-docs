# Extractors

Extractors are the start of a pipeline and are used to pull raw data from a source.
Nodestream has a number of extractors built in and you can also [create your own](../../tutorials-advanced/new-steps/#creating-an-extractor).

## The File Extractor


The `FileExtractor` is used to pull data from a file on the local filesystem, an HTTP server, or an S3 bucket.
The `FileExtractor` is accessible via the `implementation` string `nodestream.pipeline.extractors.files:FileExtractor`.

The arguments for the `FileExtractor` are:

| Argument  | Description                          | Type         | Required | Default Value |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| `sources` | A list of sources to pull data from. | `List[Dict]` | Yes      | N/A           |

Each object in the `sources` list should include a `type` key that specifies the type of extractor to use and the arguments for that extractor.

For example, to pull data from a local file, an HTTP server, and an S3 bucket, you would use the following configuration:

```yaml
implementation: nodestream.pipeline.extractors.files:UnifiedFileExtractor
arguments:
  sources:
    - type: local
      globs:
        - /path/to/local/file.csv
    - type: remote
      urls:
        - https://example.com/remote/file.csv
    - type: s3
      bucket: my-bucket
      prefix: path/to/s3/file.csv
```

#### Local Arguments

The arguments for the `local` source are:

File types are handled in a consistent manner regardles of the source of the file:

- **`.csv`** files are supported by default and yield each row of the csv file as a dictionary to the next step in the pipeline.
- **`.json`** files are supported by default and yield the entire JSON object to the next step in the pipeline.
- **`.jsonl`** files are supported by default and yield each line of the JSONL file as a dictionary to the next step in the pipeline.
- **`.parquet`** files are supported by default and yield each row of the parquet file as a dictionary to the next step in the pipeline.
- **`.txt`** files are supported by default and yield each line of the text file as a dictionary to the next step in the pipeline. (The key is `line` and the value is the line of text.)
- **`.yaml`** files are supported by default and yield the entire YAML object to the next step in the pipeline.

Compressed file formats are also supported: 

-  `.gz`: `{File Format Extension}.gz` files are decompressed using `gzip.open` and stripped of the .gz extension and processed in the subsequent extension.
- `.bz2`: `{File Format Extension}.bz2` files are decompressed using `bz2.open` and stripped of the .bz2 extension and processed in the subsequent extension.


### `QueueConnector`

The `QueueConnector` describes how to poll data from the underlying queue mechanism.

#### `AWS SQS`

```yaml
- implementation: nodestream.pipeline.extractors.queues:QueueExtractor
  arguments:
     # rest of the stream extractor format arguments
     connector: sqs
     queue_url: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/177715257436/MyQueue"
```

### Additional Arguments
With the previous minimal configuration, it will use your currently active aws credentials to read messages from
`https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/177715257436/MyQueue`. However, there are many options you can add to this:

| filter_expression                	| String 	| String expression for filtering the results (alternative to the scan_filter). See [DynamoDB Filter Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.FilterExpression) for detailed information on the format.   	|
| assume_role_arn         	| String 	| The ARN of a role to assume before interacting with the bucket. Of course the appropriate configuration is needed on both the current credentials as well as the target role.             	|
| assume_role_external_id 	| String 	| The external id that is required to assume role. Only used when `assume_role_arn` is set and only needed when the role is configured to require an external id.                           	|
| **session_args          	| Any    	| Any other argument that you want sent to the [boto3.Session](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/core/session.html) that will be used to interact with AWS. 	|


## `TimeToLiveConfigurationExtractor`

The `TimeToLiveConfigurationExtractor` is used to pull data for a Time To Live Pipeline. 
The `TimeToLiveConfigurationExtractor` is accessible via the `implementation` string `nodestream.pipeline.extractors:TimeToLiveConfigurationExtractor`.
The arguments for the `TimeToLiveConfigurationExtractor` are:


| Argument                   | Description                                                                                      | Type                   | Required | Default Value |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `configurations`           | A list of configurations for the Time To Live pipeline.                                          | `List[Dict[str, Any]]` | Yes      | N/A           |
| `graph_object_type`        | The type of object to apply the TTL to. (`NODE` or `RELATIONHIP`)                                | `str`                  | Yes      | N/A           |
| `override_expiry_in_hours` | The number of hours after which the object should be deleted. Overrides any locally set version. |
| `int`                      | No                                                                                               | N/A                    |


Each object in the `configurations` list should include the following arguments:

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------- |
| `object_type`     | The object type to apply the TTL to. (Node or relationship type)                                                                                   | `str`  | Yes      | N/A           |
| `expiry_in_hours` | The number of hours after which the object should be deleted.                                                                                      | `int`  | No       | N/A           |

## Reminder

Remember that you can always build your own extractors by implementing the `Extractor` interface. See [here](../../tutorials-advanced/new-steps) for more information.
